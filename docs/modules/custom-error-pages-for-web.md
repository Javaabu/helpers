The customer error handler that ships with this package allows you to have separate error pages for admin and web endpoints.

For example, to customize the error page for 404 HTTP status codes, create a `resources/views/web/errors/404.blade.php` view template. This view will be rendered for all 404 errors generated by your application. The views within this directory should be named to match the HTTP status code they correspond to. The `Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\HttpException` instance raised by the abort function will be passed to the view as an `$exception` variable:

```bladehtml
<h2>{{ $exception->getMessage() }}</h2>
```

## Fallback HTTP Error Pages

You may also define a "fallback" error page for a given series of HTTP status codes. This page will be rendered if there is not a corresponding page for the specific HTTP status code that occurred. To accomplish this, define a `4xx.blade.php` template and a `5xx.blade.php` template in your application's `resources/views/web/errors` directory.
